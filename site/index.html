<h2>what are connected components?</h2>
<h2>simple algorithm by just walking the graph</h2>

<p>
requires graph in memory, not parallel
</p>

<h2>propogating connected components through graph</h2>

<p>
consider the simple graph</br>

simple ruby version

<h2>m/r version</h2>

<p>
start with a relation that has node_id, a connected_component_id and a list of neighbours</br>
seed the connected_component_id with the node_id
</p>

<p>
<pre>
id   cc_id neighbours
1    1	   2
2    2	   1 3 4 5
3    3	   2 4
4    4	   2 3
5    5	   2
6    6	   7
7    7	   6
</pre>
</p>

<p>
map pass emits two types of record...
<ol>
<li>it reemits the current record (thi is so we can keep the neighbouring information across map/reduce passes)</li>
<li>emits the current cc_id for each neighbour</li>
</ol>
eg the record
<pre>
3    3	   2 4
</pre>
emits
<pre>
3    3	   2 4  # re emit current record
2    3          # send neighbour 2 our cc_id of 3 
4    3          # send neighbour 4 our cc_id of 3
</pre>
</p>

<p>
the reduce step collects the neighbours info and the <em>minimum</em> of the connected_component_ids</br>
</p>

<p>
eg the reduce step for node 3 would receive the records...
<pre>
3    4         # the cc_id of 4 sent to us from node 4
3    3    2 4  # the original record sent from ourselves (node 3)
3    2         # the cc_id of 2 sent to us from node 2
</pre>
picking the minimum cc_id of [4,3,2], 
as well as recording the neighbours (when we saw them on the 2nd record), 
we can reduce these 3 records to 
<pre>
3    2    2 4
</pre>
</p>

<p>
for the entire relation then we start with
<pre>
id   cc_id neighbours
1    1	   2
2    2	   1 3 4 5
3    3	   2 4
4    4	   2 3
5    5	   2
6    6	   7
7    7	   6
</pre>
and after one map/reduce pass we get...
<pre>
id   cc_id neighbours
1    1	   2
2    1	   1 3 4 5
3    2	   2 4
4    2	   2 3
5    2	   2
6    6	   7
7    6	   6
</pre>
after another map/reduce pass we get...
<pre>
id   cc_id neighbours
1    1	   2
2    1	   1 3 4 5
3    1	   2 4
4    1	   2 3
5    1	   2
6    6	   7
7    6	   6
</pre>
and we've now converged on the end result (ie nothing changes with another iteration)
